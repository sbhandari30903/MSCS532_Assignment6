# MSCS532_Assignment6
## DataStructures
* DataStructures folder contains all the DataStructures implementations
* array_impl.py contains array implementation using python with example
* handles basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and access
    * * To run simply click on run button on IDE or python array_impl.py
* linked_list.py contains singly linked lists with example
* handles operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal
    * * To run simply click on run button on IDE or python linked_list.py
* matix_impl.py contains matrix implementation with example.
* handles basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and access.
    * * To run simply click on run button on IDE or python matix_impl.py
* stacks_queues.py contains both stack and queue implementation with example.
* handles basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and access.
    * * To run simply click on run button on IDE or python stacks_queues.py
* rooted_tree.py contains rooted tree implementation which is based on the linked list/
* Handles add, remove child and travese.
    * * To run simply click on run button on IDE or python rooted_tree.py

## SelectionAlgorithms
* median_of_medians.py contains median_of_medians implementation.
* This algorithm finds the kth smallest element.
* It divides the array into size of 5 and sort them and get median from all.
* Gets median of medains and recursively finds the kth smallest element.
    * * To run simply click on run button on IDE or python median_of_medians.py
* rendomized_quickselect.py contains the randomized version of quickselect.
* It divides the element to the left and right of pivot element.
* Recursively tries to get the kth smallest element
    * * To run simply click on run button on IDE or python rendomized_quickselect.py
* main.py contains the implementation of median_of_medians and rendomized_quickselect.
* It runs the both selection algorithm on different size of array of different types.
* The kth is hard coded. It is 420. Please change it to your dessired value.(k < 1000)
* It gets 420th smallest element form array of different size. 
* It creates the graph of the result time taken.
* To run this on your local machine, these are the libaries required:
    * matplotlib.pyplot
    * numpy
    * python v 3.6 or higher
* To run open terminal and run **python3 main.py**
